                            Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure
                            about how to get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design
                            wanted to build a Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the
                            Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone
                            variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin
                            originated from our Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for error messages.
